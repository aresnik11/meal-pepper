Meal Pepper is an end to end Rails app where users can sign up/log in and search a database of recipes to add to custom meal plans. Users can create, edit, and delete meal plans. In addition to recipes, users can also search for wines to add to new or existing meal plans. 

Users have the option to email a copy of their shopping list to themselves, which is a list of all the ingredients from each recipe saved to their weekly meal plans.
